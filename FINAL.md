### How To Play
Explain how to play your game. Include any keyboard and/or mouse commands, game objectives, etc.

The objective of the game is the kill all the enemies, green rectangles, and advance until you beat third stage. Click "a" to move left and "d" to move right. Click the space bar to pause the game and left mouse click to shoot bullets. M resets the game to allow for unlimited shooting mechanics and r allows you to just reset.

### Changes
What changed about your game after the design phase? Separate changes that occured after the feedback round and changes that occured during programming.

After feedback:
We implemented a checkCollision method to check when the enemies hit the edges of the screen.

During programming: 
We created barriers that were not originally in the design process. This acts as a safety net between the player and the bullets from the enemies so the player has somewhere to hide to avoid getting hit by enemy bullet three times. We also added a pause feature that allows the players to pause the movements of the game if they had to step away from the keyboard. Lastly, while testing the game ourselves, we realized that the game is boringly easy, so to increase the difficulty, we added three stages (with faster moving ememies as players advance) to make the game more challenging and create a feeling of happiness when players receive the "Congrats you win!" message at the end of the third stage.
