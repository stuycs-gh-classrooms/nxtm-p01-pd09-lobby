### Changes
What changed about your game after the design phase? Separate changes that occured after the feedback round and changes that occured during programming.

After feedback:
We implemented a checkCollision method to check when the enemies hit the edges of the screen.

During programming: 
We created barriers that were not originally in the design process. This acts as a safety net between the player and the bullets from the enemies so the player has somewhere to hide to avoid getting hit by enemy bullet three times.
